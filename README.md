# workout-simplified
Simplified workout routines tailored to you

## Inspiration
Overwhelmed by the amount of workout videos online? Don't know what exercises are best for you? Frustrated with routines that can't be customized?

## What it does
Workout Simplified asks for some basic information about you, and uses that to select a short workout routine for you.

## How we built it
It is all done in the front end, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
Deciding on one single idea -- we had so many!
Implementing a progress bar that counted down time until workout completion
Getting user input while switching pages
Prioritizing features we wanted to include

## What we learned
A lot of JavaScript

## What's next for Workout Simplified
We'd like to:

Make the appearance more polished, but still staying true to the minimalistic theme
Add more exercises to the database
Add custom options, such as impact level, length of workout, and type of workout
